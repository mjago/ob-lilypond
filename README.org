** Features
 - Optional Automated LilyPond Compilation following the "Tangling"
  of a "Literate Org LilyPond" file
 - Optional Automated display of resultant Musical Score following compilation
 - Optional Automated playing of the resultant MIDI file following compilation
 - Highlights syntax errors in Org file following a failed compilation
 - Integrates with LilyPond-Mode

** Use
Hitting C-c C-c within a lilypond block initiates tangling of all
lilypond blocks. Depending on the feature settings, ob-lilypond will 
then either display a pdf of the score, play the generated midi file,
or both.

Hitting C-c C-v t (org-babel-tangle) will tangle blocks (where tangle
is not disabled), but will not perform the additional options.

** Setup (add to emacs init file)
The Files need to be downloaded to your relevant dotfiles directory
and something similar to the following placed in your Emacs init file...

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(add-to-list 'load-path
             (concat dotfiles-dir  "ob-lilypond/lib"))
(require 'ob-lilypond)

#+END_SRC
