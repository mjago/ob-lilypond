** Stages
*** DONE Get something working'ish initially
*** DONE Decide directory Structure
*** DONE Decide LilyPond-mode and lilypond-hook integration wrt ob-lilypond
Use seperate hook in ob-lilypond to auto draw / play under preferences
*** DONE Get correct basename on build files
*** DONE Add ob-ly-compile-post-tangle user variable (default t)
If ob-ly-compile-post-tangle flag set compile tangled file
Use defvar rather than defcustom for now

*** DONE Add ob-ly-draw-pdf-post-tangle  user variable (default t)
If ob-ly-draw-pdf-post-tangle is true draw pdf of tangled ly file given the
compilation didn't fail.
Use defvar rather than defcustom for now

*** DONE Add ob-ly-play-midi-post-tangle user variable (default t)
If ob-ly-play-midi-post-tangle is true play generated midi file of tangled ly file given the
compilation didn't fail.
Use defvar rather than defcustom for now
*** DONE Test whether we need to explicitly check for 
    existance of pdf and MIDI files before auto display or play
Done with warnings if lilypond doesn't generate
*** DONE Refactor org-babel-execute-tangled-ly to smaller chunks
*** DONE ly-determine-app-path refactoring
*** DONE Modify org-babel-execute:lilypond to actually perform tangle
Since ob-lilypond is currently all about tangling, modify C-c C-c
action to perform tangling and subsequent processing. This way we
no longer need to use post-tangle-hook and differentiates between
simple tangling, and tangle + processing.
*** DONE Add command to toggle playing of midi file
*** DONE Add command to toggle displaying pdf file
*** DONE Modify so that given a syntax error ob-lilypond will attempt 
    to highlight the line containing the error in the original
    pre-tangled org file (rather than the generated ly file)
*** DONE Remove the need to explicitly indicate tangled lilypond blocks
This will mean that all lilypond blocks are :tangle: yes by default,
which currently makes sense - enabled by passing in "yes" as tangle
file to org-babel-tangle

*** DONE Further Refactor example.org
*** DONE Export html version of example.org and add to repo
*** DONE Add exported link to readme
*** DONE Add ly-toggle-png-generation command
*** DONE Port to Ubuntu

*** DONE Figure out export with lower case lilypond restriction
*** DONE Decide How to handle OS dependencies
 - midi player
 - pdf viewer
 - LilyPond location (Set up seperate binary paths relative to OS)
 - LilyPond API (OSX needs special treatment at the very least
*** DONE Remove noise by setting :results . "silent" as lilypond default
*** DONE Figure out why Emacs occasionally auto-loads filename.lilypond!
**** DONE Reduced scope of (save-excursion) to avoid this - doesn't help
**** DONE Perhaps need unwind-protection - causes issues
**** TODO Modify error marking to use absolute block size counting for location
**** TODO Research when an extra option was added to THE FRONT of org-babel-tangle option list
Why why why add new options to the front of the list and guarantee non-backwards
compatability
May need a note in docs or a test of version.

*** DONE Add examples using org-babel for programmatic note generation
*** WAITING Get feedback from Shelagh regarding direction and current 
*** DONE Add :noweb "yes" and :comments "yes" as lilypond defaults
*** TODO Modify Readme to include paths to examples
*** TODO Add usage information [1/3]
 - [ ] Font-lock fontify in blocks by default
 - [ ] Practical effects of default ob-lilypond header parameters
 - [X] List of commands
*** DONE Post to org mailing list in hope of some feedback
*** TODO How to refactor Ruby stuff in examples for DRY 
Need to work out how to chain babel blocks which are passing parameters.
*** TODO Re-check in Ubuntu
*** TODO Port to a win32 machine
*** TODO Modify error marking / linking to use :headers "yes" [0/5]
By defaulting :headers to "yes" in ob-lilypond I can map error to original
org file more reliably by utilising the link information in the
generated header. 
 - [ ] Consider generating link in *lilypond* build results
 - [ ] Make "syntax marking" optional since we have the link - or remove?
 - [ ] Fall back to the current best guess if :headers "no" is used?
 - [ ] If marking is used, need to expand just the relevant heading
*** TODO Improve examples [0/4]
 - [ ] Swap modal-cycle 1 and 2 as 2 is probably the more useful 
 - [ ] Add notes on how modal cycles are generated and there relevance
 - [ ] Would love to add a harmonic series example to 'evolve' major scale
 - [ ] Check Misty - Errol Garner is out of copywright, if not swap with
   "Empathy"

*** TODO Devise a "mode" for generating liypond partials as embedded png images
